    <h2>Why BSIT?</h2>
    <p>Deciding what to study in college is one of those moments that feels huge and a little scary. I wanted to pick something that I’d enjoy, something I could be proud of, and something that would open doors for me in the future. After a lot of thinking, exploring, and some trial and error, I chose to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, or BSIT.
       And honestly, it feels like the right choice for me — a blend of my curiosity, my skills, and my hopes for what I want to do in life. If I look back to when my interest in technology started, I realize it wasn’t a sudden thing — it was little moments that added up over time. As a kid, I was always fascinated by gadgets and computers.
      
       Unlike some kids who just played games or watched videos, I was the one trying to figure out how things worked behind the scenes. I remember opening up an old computer just to see what was inside. I didn’t really know what all the parts did, but I was amazed by how all these pieces worked together to make a machine that could do so many things.<br>
    
       I started watching tutorials and reading articles online, trying to understand programming, websites, and even how hackers could break into systems. It was like discovering a whole new language and world — one full of endless possibilities. I realized that technology wasn’t just about fun stuff or convenience; it was about creating solutions, connecting people, and even protecting what’s important.</p>

    <p>When it came time to choose a college course, I wanted something that would help me turn that passion into real skills. That’s when I found out about BSIT. I liked how it covered so many areas — programming, networking, databases, cybersecurity, and even web development. It wasn’t just about learning theory but actually doing things hands-on, building projects, and solving real problems. 
        What really stood out to me was how flexible the program is. I don’t have to decide right away what specific IT job I want because BSIT lets me explore different fields first. I’m especially interested in cybersecurity — the idea of protecting people’s data and privacy really motivates me — but I’m also excited to learn about coding and system analysis. BSIT gives me that chance to find my own path.
        I won’t lie, I also thought a lot about practicality. Technology is everywhere now — in schools, hospitals, banks, businesses, even the devices in our homes. Knowing this, I felt like choosing BSIT was not just following my passion but making a smart decision for my future. IT jobs are in high demand, and that means better chances for steady work and growth.
        But more than the paycheck or job security, I want to do something that matters. I believe technology can change lives — for the better. I’ve seen how it helped people stay connected during tough times like the pandemic, and how businesses can operate more smoothly because of good IT systems.<br>
        I also chose BSIT because it fits who I am. I’ve always liked figuring things out — puzzles, problems, logic games — and IT feels like a big, exciting puzzle. I enjoy working step-by-step, breaking down problems, and seeing how different parts connect. Programming especially feels like that, where you write code and watch it come alive.
        I’m not someone who learns best by just reading or listening. I like to try things out myself, experiment, and fix mistakes. The hands-on nature of BSIT means I’ll get to do just that — build projects, collaborate with others, and learn by doing. I think this style will keep me engaged and make my learning deeper and more meaningful.</p>
    
    <p>I know BSIT won’t always be easy. I’ve heard stories of late nights debugging code, struggling with complex theories, and juggling many projects at once. But honestly, I’m ready for that. I see challenges as chances to learn and grow. I’m motivated by the idea that every problem solved is a step forward.
       I’m also looking forward to working with classmates, learning from professors, and getting real-world experience through internships. I want to be open to feedback, willing to ask for help, and ready to push myself because I know that’s how I’ll get better. Looking ahead, I’m excited about where BSIT can take me. Right now, I’m leaning toward cybersecurity because I want to help protect people and organizations from threats. But I’m also curious about other areas like software development and data analysis, and I’m open to discovering new interests along the way.
       Eventually, I want to work in a company that challenges me and values innovation. I want to contribute to projects that really help people or businesses, whether by making systems safer, faster, or easier to use. Beyond working for someone else, I even dream of starting my own tech business someday, creating solutions that matter to my community.
       But no matter where I end up, I want to keep learning. Technology changes fast, and staying updated is part of the job. I’m ready to embrace lifelong learning because I know it’s the key to staying relevant and successful.<br>
       To me, BSIT is more than just a course or a way to get a job. It’s a way to connect my passion, my skills, and my dreams into a meaningful path. It’s the chance to challenge myself, grow every day, and use what I learn to make a difference. Choosing BSIT feels like choosing a future where I’m not just watching technology happen — I’m part of making it happen.</p>
